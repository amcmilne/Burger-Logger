# Burger-Logger
In this assignment, I created a burger logger using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

## [Burger Logger Demo](./public/gif/burger.gif)

* Whenever a user chooses a burger name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting for payment.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Pay` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* When the user confirms they picked up their burger they will click the `Goodbye` button, and the burger will be removed.
